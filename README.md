# Hi there 👋, I'm Jaylen!

I'm an **AI Evaluation Specialist & Data Analyst** who studies how language models behave, break, and improve. By day, I work in manufacturing data and process optimization. By night, I evaluate LLMs through RLHF, build bias auditing pipelines, and run independent research on algorithmic behavior.

I believe the best AI evaluators are the ones building things — not just rating outputs.

## 🔬 What I'm Working On

- **Project Lara** — An end-to-end ML bias auditing pipeline with a Streamlit dashboard *(in progress)*
- Conducting RLHF evaluations and Python code audits for production AI models
- Deepening statistical reasoning through Google Advanced Data Analytics coursework

## ✨ Featured Project

### [The Aiasuka Effect: Algorithmic Gender Bias in Web3](https://github.com/jaylenhester/aiasuka-data-project)

A controlled 3-week field experiment measuring how synthetic feminine personas alter audience engagement on X. Designed the study, built a Python data pipeline (Pandas), and validated a statistically significant **47% spike in impressions** using independent t-tests and one-way ANOVA. The research documents how algorithmic amplification of idealized personas leads to measurable trust erosion.
